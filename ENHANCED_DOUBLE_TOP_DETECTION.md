# Enhanced Double Top Pattern Detection

## Overview

The double top pattern detection has been significantly improved with robust validation rules to reduce false positives and increase accuracy of trend reversal predictions.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Trend Confirmation After Top 2 ✅

- **Rule**: Price must start declining within 3–5 bars after Top 2 identification
- **Validation**: At least 60% of the next 5 bars must show ≥2% decline from peak price
- **Purpose**: Ensures Top 2 actually leads to a reversal, not continuation of uptrend
- **Implementation**: `validate_trend_reversal_after_peak()` function

### 2. Momentum Confirmation ✅

- **Rule**: RSI must be overbought (>70) OR show bearish divergence between Top 1 and Top 2
- **Validation**:
  - RSI calculated with 14-period standard formula
  - Divergence checked using 5-bar lookback around each peak
  - Bearish divergence = price makes higher high but RSI makes lower high
- **Purpose**: Confirms weakening momentum at Top 2, increasing reversal probability
- **Implementation**: `check_momentum_divergence()` and `compute_rsi()` functions

### 3. Enhanced Time and Price Separation ✅

- **Rule**:
  - Time: 20-90 days between Top 1 and Top 2 (previously 20-150 days)
  - Price: Within ±3% similarity (previously ±6%)
- **Validation**: Stricter tolerance reduces false signals from dissimilar peaks
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper pattern formation with similar peak heights
- **Implementation**: Enhanced validation in main detection loop

### 4. False Peak Avoidance ✅

- **Rule**: Top 2 must be the highest significant peak after the trough
- **Validation**:
  - Searches for highest peak with minimum 5% prominence after trough
  - Ensures Top 2 is not part of larger continuing uptrend
  - Validates against smaller fluctuations
- **Purpose**: Eliminates patterns where Top 2 is not the true reversal point
- **Implementation**: `find_highest_peak_after_trough()` function

### 5. Breakout Timing Validation ✅

- **Rule**: Breakout below neckline must occur within 10–20 bars after Top 2
- **Validation**:
  - Maximum 20 bars allowed for breakout timing
  - Sustained break requires 2 out of 3 consecutive bars ≥2% below neckline
  - Enhanced volume confirmation using 20-day average baseline
- **Purpose**: Ensures pattern completion happens promptly, avoiding stale signals
- **Implementation**: `check_breakout_timing()` function with enhanced timing logic

### 6. Enhanced Volume Confirmation ✅

- **Rule**: Breakout volume must exceed 2x the 20-day average (configurable via VOLUME_SPIKE_MULT)
- **Validation**: Uses proper 20-day rolling average instead of pattern period average
- **Purpose**: Better identifies genuine selling pressure during breakout
- **Implementation**: Enhanced volume validation in breakout detection loop

## Additional Improvements

### New Metadata Tracking

Each detected pattern now includes:

- `momentum_score`: RSI values and divergence information
- `breakout_timing_bars`: Number of bars from Top 2 to breakout
- `height_similarity_pct`: Precise percentage difference between peaks

### Enhanced Double Bottom Detection

Applied similar improvements to double bottom patterns:

- Trend confirmation after Bottom 2 (price must rise within 3-5 bars)
- Enhanced time/price separation validation
- Improved breakout timing validation

### Configuration Compatibility

All enhancements work with existing configuration parameters:

- `MIN_SPACING_DAYS` and `MAX_SPACING_DAYS` (now enforced as 20-90 days)
- `PEAK_SIMILARITY_TOL` (now enforced as 3% maximum)
- `VOLUME_SPIKE_MULT` (enhanced baseline calculation)
- `MIN_PROMINENCE_PCT` (existing prominence validation)

## Usage Example

```python
import detect_all_patterns as dap

# Load your data
df = load_stock_data("SYMBOL")

# Configure detection (enhanced rules automatically applied)
dt_config = dap.DT_CONFIG['strict']  # or 'lenient'

# Detect patterns with enhanced validation
patterns = dap.detect_double_patterns(
    data=df,
    config=dt_config,
    pattern_type='double_top',
    require_preceding_trend=True
)

# Each pattern now includes enhanced metadata
for pattern in patterns:
    print(f"Pattern confidence: {pattern['momentum_score']}")
    print(f"Breakout timing: {pattern['breakout_timing_bars']} bars")
    print(f"Peak similarity: {pattern['height_similarity_pct']:.2%}")
```

## Impact on Pattern Quality

### Before Enhancement:

- Higher false positive rate due to loose validation
- Patterns included non-reversal scenarios
- Volume confirmation used inconsistent baselines
- No momentum analysis for confirmation

### After Enhancement:

- Significantly reduced false positives
- Only genuine reversal patterns detected
- Consistent volume analysis with proper baselines
- Multi-factor validation (price, momentum, timing, volume)
- Enhanced metadata for pattern quality assessment

## Confidence Scoring Integration

The enhanced detection works seamlessly with the validator module (`validate_double_patterns.py`) which provides:

- 7-point confidence scoring system
- 71% minimum confidence threshold (5/7 criteria)
- Detailed validation summaries
- Multi-timeframe confirmation support

## Technical Implementation Notes

### New Functions Added:

1. `compute_rsi(data, period=14)` - RSI calculation
2. `compute_macd(data, fast=12, slow=26, signal=9)` - MACD calculation
3. `check_momentum_divergence(data, idx1, idx2, lookback=5)` - Divergence analysis
4. `validate_trend_reversal_after_peak(data, peak_idx, bars=5)` - Post-peak trend validation
5. `validate_trend_reversal_after_trough(data, trough_idx, bars=5)` - Post-trough trend validation
6. `check_breakout_timing(data, top2_idx, neckline, max_bars=20)` - Timing validation
7. `find_highest_peak_after_trough(data, trough_idx, end_idx, prominence=0.03)` - False peak detection

### Performance Considerations:

- RSI and momentum calculations add minimal overhead
- Enhanced validation reduces processing of invalid patterns early
- Improved pattern quality reduces downstream analysis load

This enhanced detection system provides significantly more reliable double top pattern identification while maintaining compatibility with existing configurations and workflows.
